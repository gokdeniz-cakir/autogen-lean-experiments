--- Visionary (gpt-4o) ---
Visionary: Envision each household with reflective roofs and wall gardens to naturally cool homes. Empower communities to establish 'Cool Zones' in public spaces with solar-powered misting stations. Incentivize pooled resources for neighborhood-wide smart water management systems to conserve and utilize water efficiently during heat peaks. Advocate for localized microgrid installations to ensure power continuity for air conditioning through renewable energy. Encourage planting of native shade trees and creation of green corridors for heat absorption and habitat sustenance. Foster a community culture of heat-health awareness through regular workshops, promoting hydration, and identifying vulnerable populations for collective care. Leverage citizen science to monitor local temperatures, influencing data-driven infrastructure adaptability.

--- Planner (gpt-4.1-mini) ---
Planner: Begin by urging residents to plant native shade trees and create small green spaces to reduce heat naturally. Recommend using reflective roof paint and wall gardens to cool homes without high costs. Suggest setting up community 'Cool Zones' equipped with water misting stations and shaded seating. Encourage neighbors to share water-saving tips and consider simple rainwater harvesting for gardening. Promote regular hydration and check-ins on vulnerable neighbors, especially the elderly. Advocate organizing informal workshops or meetings to raise heat-health awareness and share resources. Finally, mention citizen science apps for tracking local temperatures to help the community adapt faster. These practical steps make neighborhoods safer and more resilient during heat waves.

--- Skeptic (gpt-4.1) ---
Skeptic: While most suggestions are actionable, several face feasibility issues: installing reflective roofs, wall gardens, and community misting stations may require resources, permissions, or sustained funding beyond average residents' reach. Microgrids and pooled water management, though visionary, are complex and not immediately actionable for neighborhoods without technical or financial support. Reliance on citizen science apps assumes tech access and digital literacy—often not universal. The mention of "check-ins" is good, but needs clearer structure for accountability. More emphasis is needed on low-cost, high-impact actions like window coverings and fan use, and clearer distinctions between individual and community-level tasks. Overall, the plan's inspiration is strong, but practical gaps remain. Verdict: NEEDS WORK.
